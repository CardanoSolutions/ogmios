-- | A default handler for unmatched requests. This is an attempt to provide
-- better error messages without adding too much complexity to the above
-- handlers.
--
-- Each handler is rather isolated and independent. They aren't aware of other
-- handlers and this makes them easy to extend or modify independently. A direct
-- consequence if that, from a single handler it is hard to tell whether a
-- request is totally invalid in the context of Ogmios, or simply invalid for
-- that particular handler.
--
-- When a handler fails to parse a request, it simply passes it to the next
-- handler in the pipeline. Ultimately, once all handlers have passed, we end up
-- with a request that wasn't proceeded successfully but, the reason why that is
-- are unclear at this stage:
--
-- - Is the request just a gibberish input?
-- - Is the request an almost valid 'FindIntersect' but with an error on the
--   argument?
-- - Is the request an almost valid 'SubmitTx' but with a slightly invalid
--   transaction body?
--
-- This is what this function tries to answer and yield back to users. To some
-- extent, it redoes some of the parsing work above, but it only occurs on
-- client errors. This way, base handlers are kept clean and fast for normal
-- processing.
