{"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code":3124,"message":"Some discriminated entities in the transaction are configured for another network. In fact, payment addresses, stake addresses and stake pool registration certificates are bound to a specific network identifier. This identifier must match the network you're trying to submit them to. Since the Alonzo era, transactions themselves may also contain a network identifier. The field 'data.expectedNetwork' indicates what is the currrently expected network. The field 'data.discriminatedType' indicates what type of entity is causing an issue here.
