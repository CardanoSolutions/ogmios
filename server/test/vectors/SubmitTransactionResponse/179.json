The version (major, minor, patch) follows strict rules which can be summarized as follow: (1) the new triplet must be greater than the current one in the usual order of priorities (i.e. 'major' -> 'minor' -> 'patch'), (2) 'minor' must be 0 if 'major' is bumped, (3) 'minor' can only be bumped in increments of 1 and only if 'major' isn't bumped and (4) 'major' can only be bumped in increments of 1. The field 'data.proposedVersion' indicates the (invalid) version in the submitted proposal whereas 'data.currentVersion' indicates the current protocol version.","data":{"proposedVersion":{"major":7,"minor":18},"currentVersion":{"major":7,"minor":27}}},"id":null}
