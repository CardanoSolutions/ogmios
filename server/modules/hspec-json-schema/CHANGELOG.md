### Changed

- The `SchemaRef` references are now resolved outside of the property, to avoid unnecessary file-system accesses and speed up the test execution (~40%). Instead, the schema and resolved reference have to be fetched prior to calling `prop_validateToJSON` using `unsafeReadSchemaRef`.

## [1.0.0] -- 2020-10-23

### Added

- Initial release. The API is very simple and offer a single function 'validateToJSON' 
  which is as capable as `hjsonschema`. The output is not perfect but tries its best to 
  format errors generated by hjsonschema properly.
