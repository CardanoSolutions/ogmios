# Contributing

## What can you contribute?

1. Feedback

   Contributions in the form of feedback and issue is very much welcome. Might it be a suggestion, a bug report or maybe some questions that you have. It helps improving Ogmios in the long run and these are probably the best kind of contributions to start with. 

2. Code 

   Refer to the 'building' and 'testing' sections of the [user-manual](https://ogmios.dev) if you're willing to hack a bit on Ogmios. The project follows a quite strict architecture as detailed in the README and coding standards are enforced using tools and configuration defined on the repository. Make sure to configure your editor to pick them up. Pull requests are welcome, but we do recommend to open an issue to bring any idea to discussion first! 

3. Donation
