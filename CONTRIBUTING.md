## What & How Can You Contribute?

1. **Feedback**

   Contributions in the form of feedback and issue is very much welcome. Might it be a suggestion, a bug report or maybe some questions that you have. It helps improving Ogmios in the long run and these are probably the best kind of contributions to start with. 

   Do not hesitate to add _thumbs up :+1:_ on open issues you support to show your interest. 

2. **Code** 

   Refer to the [building](https://ogmios.dev/getting-started/building/) and [testing](https://ogmios.dev/getting-started/testing/) sections of the [user-manual](https://ogmios.dev) if you're willing to hack a bit on Ogmios. The project follows a quite strict architecture as detailed in the [server's README](https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/ogmios/tree/master/server#architecture). 

   Past (and future) design decisions have been (will be) recorded as [Architectural Decision Records](https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/ogmios/tree/master/architectural-decisions/accepted). Have a look at them before you start hacking to better understand some of trade-offs made during the development.

   Coding standards are enforced using tools and configuration defined in the repository. Make sure to configure your editor to pick them up. 

   Pull requests are welcome, but we do recommend to open an issue to bring any idea to discussion first! 

3. **Donation**
