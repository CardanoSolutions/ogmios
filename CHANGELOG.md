### edge / unreleased

#### Added

- Integrated with the Cardano eco-system corresponding to cardano-node@1.27.0. Bumped the docker-compose installation accordingly.

- Three new possible errors from the transaction submission coming with cardano-node@1.27.0:

  - `mirTransferNotCurrentlyAllowed`
  - `mirNegativeTransferNotCurrentlyAllowed`
  - `mirProducesNegativeUpdate`

  These errors are related to transactions issuing MIR certificates which can only be done by 
  genesis delegates. So this change should not impact any 'standard' user. 

#### Changed

- :warning: **Breaking-Change** :warning: Auxiliary data's `scriptPreImages` in Allegra & Mary has been replaced with a field `scripts` which has one field `native`. The value of `native` corresponds to what used to be the value of `scriptPreImages`. In Alonzo, `scripts` may also have another field `plutus` with a serialized Plutus script. 

- :warning: **Breaking-Change** :warning: Transactions witnesses' `address` has been renamed into `signatures`, and the structure of the object has been changed to be a map from public keys to signatures (instead of an object with two field `key` & `signature`). 

- :warning: **Breaking-Change** :warning: Transactions witnesses' `script` has been renamed into `scripts`.

- :warning: **Breaking-Change** :warning: Transaction submission errors' `networkMismatch` now returns an `invalidEntities` list of object in the form of `{ "type": ..., "entity": }` where `type` is a text tag designating the type of entity for which there is a network identifier mismatch. Values can be `address`, `rewardAccount` and since Alonzo `transactionBody`. The `entity` field contains some details specific to the type of entity. Before, it used to be two distinct fields `invalidAddresses` and `invalidRewardAccounts`. 

- :warning: **Breaking-Change** :warning: Empty transaction metadata are no longer materialized by an object with two null fields (`{ "hash": null, "body": null }`). Empty transaction metadata are now equal to `null`. 

- :warning: **Breaking-Change** :warning: `map` metadatum in transactions' metadata are no longer materialized as a list of list of singleton objects: `[[{ "k": ... }, { "v": ... }], ...]` but instead, as a list of object with two fields `k` and `v`: `[{ "k": ..., "v": ...}, ...]`. This was an oversight from the encoder which was never intended to end up that way but happened to slip in because the schema for metadatum was not specified / documented (and therefore, also escaped testing). This is now documented properly.

- The `moveInstantaneousRewards` certificates have a new optional field `value` and not only a `rewards` map as before. 
  When `value` is present, it signifies that rewards are moved to the other pot. 

- The 'networkMismatch` error can now also be related to a mismatch from the network and the reward account coming from a 
  pool registration certificate.

### [3.2.0] - 2021-05-09

#### Added

- New TypeScript client! The client comes in three packages:
  - An interactive REPL to play with Ogmios using the command-line.
  - A generator to derive TypeScript type definitions from the JSON schema.
  - The actual client library providing nice wrapper around the various protocol, in a typed way.
  The TypeScript client also includes a new battery of automated integration tests against the testnet. 
- Support for WebSocket sub-protocols, with currently one support sub-protocol: `ogmios.compact.v1`. When enabled,
  Ogmios will omit fields such as witnesses, proofs and signatures from responses to make responses smaller.
- Provide missing documentation / JSON-schema for:
  - JSON-WSP faults
  - Allegra & Mary `SubmitTx` failures:
    - Allegra:
      - `expiredUtxo` is replaced by `outsideOfValidityInterval`
      - new error `triesToForgeAda`

      Mary:
      - `valueNotConserved.consumed` is now a `Value` (instead of a `DeltaCoin`)
      - `valueNotConserved.produced` is now a `Value` (instead of a `DeltaCoin`)
      - `outputTooSmall` items are now of type `TxOut[Mary]`
      - new error `tooManyAssetsInOutput`
- Continuous integration job checking for code style and lint on the server source code.
- The `/health` endpoint now returns two additional pieces of information:
  - A `networkSynchronization` percentage to indicate how far Ogmios / the node is from the network.
  - A `currentEra` value to indicate the corresponding Cardano era Ogmios / the node is currently running in.
- Nix support for building Ogmios (this also include a `cabal.project` to enable cabal support as well).

#### Changed

- Rework Docker setup to not require an external snapshot image. Everything is now built in a single
  `Dockerfile`, but cache from DockerHub can be leveraged to reduce overall build time when building
  from scratch.
- Fixed typo in the JSON-schema w.r.t to the 'Acquire' request (`points` → `point`), and introduce more automated test
  to catch this kind of errors more easily.

### [3.1.0] - 2021-04-04

#### Added

- Extend the local-state query protocol with support for 'GetCompactGenesis'.
- Extend the local-state query protocol with support for 'GetFilteredDelegationsAndRewards'.
- Add missing `mint` field to transaction's body (added since mary).
- The documentation is now hosted on https://ogmios.dev.

#### Changed

- Use 'contentEncoding' over 'format' in appropriate part of the JSON schema.
- Fix various errors in the JSON-schema definition & extend test suite coverage in consequence.
- Implement a 'fast-bech32' encoding library, to speed-up Ogmios serialization of blocks beyond the Shelley era.
- Use faster (and recommended) JSON encoding techniques to speed up overall JSON serialization. 
- Improve generated documentation from JSON schema by:
  - Providing titles to 'oneOf' items
  - Adding descriptions to top-level definitions
  - Adding examples to top-level definitions
- Customized API reference's stylesheet to enhance readability.
- Upgrade dependency and code to work with GHC-8.10.4 (from GHC 8.6.5)
- Handle more gracefully unknown exceptions (avoid infinite fast loop of retries on errors).
- Handle more gracefully network mismatches (e.g. connecting Ogmios in testnet mode to a mainnet network)
- Repository reorganization:
  - 'ogmios-server' renamed into 'server'
  - move Haskell-specific dotfiles and configuration files under 'server'
  - move 'modules' under 'server'
  - move 'Dockerfile' and 'snapshot.Dockerfile' under 'server'

#### Removed

- Support for GHC-8.6.5
- The docker image no longer shows git revision / version on '--version'

### [3.0.0] -- 2021-02-26

#### Added

- Support for the Allegra era on the chain-sync, tx submission and state query protocols.
- Support for the Mary era on the chain-sync, tx submission and state query protocols.
- Support for multi-era state queries, or said differently, Ogmios can survive a hard-fork without being restarted or re-compiled. 
- Allow clients to also make state queries based on the node's tip (instead of passing an explicit point to acquire).
- Interactive dashboard leveraging Ogmios health's endpoint and local state query protocol to show metrics in real-time.
- Automated smoke sanity tests executed on a running instance, running queries and chain-syncs across all eras.
- Various internal optimization, in particular with rewards to the chain-sync protocol (~14.000 blocks/s in Byron, ~2500 block/s in Shelley and beyond).
- Additional metrics for monitoring: current heap size, total messages, total unrouted messages and start time.  
- Configurable HTTP server timeout from the command-line, with sensible defaults.

#### Changed

- Improve error responses to invalid clients' requests (instead of generic error messages).
- Fixed various typos and clumsy wording in the user manual.
- Reworked internal architecture as a Three-Layer Haskell Cake.
- Changed internal dependencies for base16 and base64 encoding for better performances.
- Upgraded internal dependencies to the Cardano eco-system working with cardano-node@1.25.1
- Improved error handling of the Ogmios server, in particular in case of connections lost with the underlying node.
- The server now returns an explicit client error when interleaving 'FindIntersect' messages in-between pipelined 'RequestNext'.
- Revised default compilation flags .
