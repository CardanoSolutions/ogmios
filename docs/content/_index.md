# Ogmios

[**Ogmios**](https://github.com/KtorZ/cardano-ogmios) is a protocol translation service written in Haskell running on top of [cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/). It offers a **JSON** interface through **WebSockets** and enables applications to speak [Ouroboros' client mini-protocols](https://hydra.iohk.io/build/1070091/download/1/network.pdf#chapter.3) via remote procedure calls. Ogmios is a **fast** and **lightweight** solution that can be deployed alongside relays to create entry points on the Cardano network for various types of applications (e.g. wallets, explorers, chatbots, dashboards...).
