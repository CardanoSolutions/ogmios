Ogmios as a JSON-WSP service is entirely described using [JSON Schema - Draft 7](https://json-schema.org/). This can be fed into various tools to generate code, data-types or definitions in many languages. Ogmios is tested against this schema as well, to make sure that it remains up-to-date as new features are added.
