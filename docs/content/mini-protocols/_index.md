# Ouroboros Mini-Protocols

In this section, we'll give practical insights about interacting with the [Ouroboros mini-protocols](https://hydra.iohk.io/build/1070091/download/1/network.pdf#chapter.3). Each sub-section will focus on one particular protocol, give an overview and give examples in JavaScript using Ogmios.
