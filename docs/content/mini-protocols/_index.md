# Mini-Protocols

In this section, we'll give practical insights about interacting with the [Ouroboros mini-protocols](https://input-output-hk.github.io/ouroboros-network/pdfs/network-spec/network-spec.pdf#chapter.3). Each sub-section will focus on one particular protocol, give an overview and give examples in JavaScript using Ogmios.
