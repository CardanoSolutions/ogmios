# Getting started

Find in this section information about building and running Ogmios. This will cover installation from both sources and [docker 🐳](https://www.docker.com/), as well as details about options and configuration for running Ogmios.

If you want to get started right away, you can use one of our [starter kit](https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/ogmios-ts-client-starter-kit) for _TypeScript_. It'll teach you the basics through end-to-end examples. Using VSCode? Make it even easier by using a cloud-based environment on [demeter.run](https://demeter.run/)👇.
