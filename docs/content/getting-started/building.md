## Pre-requisites (Server)

Ogmios is built using the great Haskell build tool [cabal](https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en). You'll also need [git](https://git-scm.com/) to clone the source code, that is:
- `git 2.11.*`
- `cabal 3.*.*`

Ogmios in itself is a rather small project, yet it's using library directly from the ouroboros-network, cardano-ledger-specs and cardano-node projects. This is handy for re-using existing logic, but comes at the cost of several system dependencies that are required for building everything. Some may already be installed on your system, but the complete list is:

- `libsodium-dev 1.0.*`
- `libgmp-dev 6.1.*`
- `libssl-dev 1.1.*`
- `libpcre3-dev 2.8.*`
- `libsystemd-dev`
- `zlib1g-dev 1.2.*`
- A custom revision of bitcoin-core's secp256k1, with Schnorr signature support enabled:
  ```console
  git clone https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1.git
  cd secp256k1
  git reset --hard ac83be33d0956faf6b7f61a60ab524ef7d6a473a
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-module-schnorrsig --enable-experimental
  make
  make check
  sudo make install
  ```

## üî® Server

Clone the git repository from Github:

```console
$ git clone --depth 1 --recursive --shallow-submodules git@github.com:cardanosolutions/ogmios.git
$ cd cardano-ogmios/server
```

Then, use cabal to compile the project source code from the `server` directory:

```console
$ cabal build all
```

The first time, this may take a while as cabal needs to setup a compilation environment and to download a lot of dependencies. Subsequent executions are much faster.

From there, you can run Ogmios via cabal using the `run` command:

```console
$ cabal run ogmios:exe:ogmios -- --help
```

Alternatively, you can instrument cabal to copy the compiled executable elsewhere so that you can run Ogmios all by itself:

```console
$ cabal install ogmios:exe:ogmios --install-method=copy --overwrite-policy=always
$ ogmios --help
```

## üî® TypeScript Client

Clone the git repository from Github:

```console
$ git clone --depth 1 --recursive --shallow-submodules git@github.com:cardanosolutions/ogmios.git
$ cd cardano-ogmios/clients/TypeScript
```

Then, use Yarn to install dependencies and compile the project source code from the
`client/TypeScript` directory:

```console
$ yarn install \
  && yarn build
```

## üìö Documentation

The documentation can be generated from the TypeScript client workbench. Follow the instruction in the README to setup the TypeScript workspace, and then run:

```console
$ yarn docs
```

This will generate documentation for the API and the TypeScript clients in `/docs/static` to be served by the static website generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/documentation/).

Alternatively, you can also look at our [User-Guide Github Workflow](https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/ogmios/blob/master/.github/workflows/user-guide.yaml#L18-L30) to see how its done.
