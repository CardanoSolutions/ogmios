# commit 2ac18c77266348c86db396e731a86d730c316c5b (HEAD -> 1.20.0, origin/1.20.0)

#
#     makes it possible to run an effect in the first callback of 'CollectResponse'
#
#     A typical client would here want to be able to run extra computation in
#     order to carry on and do whatever it needs to do to collect or constuct
#     the next request to send. Being restricted to only pure computation
#     here makes it fairly hard to pipelined another request unless the
#     request can be constructed out of thin air or, has already been
#     collected and buffered upfront.
