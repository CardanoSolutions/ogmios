# commit 1ab3fe2fff75141fcfb99e013fe5de33ce5a73d0 (HEAD -> 1.19.1, origin/1.19.1)

#
#     makes it possible to run an effect in the first callback of 'CollectResponse'
#
#     A typical client would here want to be able to run extra computation in
#     order to carry on and do whatever it needs to do to collect or constuct
#     the next request to send. Being restricted to only pure computation here
#     makes it fairly hard to pipelined another request unless the request can
#     be constructed out of thin air or, has already been collected and
#     buffered upfront.
